      <p2>2.<b>Music Player UI</b>
        This music player user interface is a basic design for creating a simple and easy-to-use music app. It includes an album artwork space, song title, artist name, progress bar, playback buttons (shuffle, previous, play/pause, next, repeat), a favorite button, and a waveform display. These features help users control their music smoothly while keeping the design clear and engaging. A well-designed user interface makes the app more interactive, enjoyable, and adaptable for different devices like phones, websites, or computers.</p2>

      <p>3. Jey Uso's theme song is an energetic mix of hip-hop and tribal sounds, reflecting his Samoan roots and powerful character. It has bold beats and chanting, building excitement as he enters the ring, especially in the Bloodline storyline.   <b>Importance for Building Music:</b>
      This is important for building music because the player needs to handle strong beats and vocals without distortion. It also needs to offer features like looping, volume control, and clear sound quality to enhance the listening experience.
