      <p2>2.<b>Music Player UI</b>
        This music player user interface is a basic design for creating a simple and easy-to-use music app. It includes an album artwork space, song title, artist name, progress bar, playback buttons (shuffle, previous, play/pause, next, repeat), a favorite button, and a waveform display. These features help users control their music smoothly while keeping the design clear and engaging. A well-designed user interface makes the app more interactive, enjoyable, and adaptable for different devices like phones, websites, or computers.</p2>

      <p>3. <b>Jey Uso’s “Main Event Ish”</b> theme combines tribal beats and hip-hop, showing his Samoan roots and strong persona. It creates excitement for his entrance.

        For a music player, it's important because the track has powerful beats and vocals that need to be clear. The player must have good sound quality, volume control, and smooth playback to enhance the listening experience.

<!--Improved Page Load Time: By placing the JavaScript at the end, the browser can load and render the HTML content first, which improves the perceived load time for the user.

Avoid Blocking: If JavaScript is placed in the <head> section, it can block the rendering of the page until the script is fully downloaded and executed. This can make the page appear to load slowly.

DOM Availability: Placing JavaScript at the end ensures that the DOM (Document Object Model) is fully constructed before the script runs. This is crucial for scripts that manipulate or interact with the DOM elements.-->
