Code Explanation

setup()

The setup() function is called once at the beginning of the program. It's used to set up initial conditions, such as window size, background color, or variables. In this code, it sets up full-screen mode and defines the size and position of shapes.
fullScreen()

This function sets the window to fill the entire screen. It makes the sketch take up the entire display, rather than running in a window with borders.
displayWidth and displayHeight

These are built-in variables in Processing that give the width and height of the screen (in pixels). displayWidth gives the screen width, and displayHeight gives the screen height. They are used to calculate the positions and size of shapes in the sketch.
rect()

The rect() function is used to draw rectangles on the screen. It requires four parameters:
x: The horizontal position (from the left).
y: The vertical position (from the top).
width: The width of the rectangle.
height: The height of the rectangle.
In this code, the rect() function is used to draw a large rectangle in the center of the screen and several small squares below it.
int

The int data type is used to store whole numbers (integers) in Java/Processing. It is used for variables like appWidth and appHeight, which store the screen dimensions as integers.
float

The float data type is used to store numbers that can have decimals (floating-point numbers). For example, rectWidth and rectHeight store decimal values that represent 40% of the screen width and height.
for loop

A for loop is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. The for loop in this code runs 5 times (to draw 5 small squares) by incrementing a counter i each time. The code inside the loop will be executed repeatedly, with i taking values from 0 to 4.
squareX = rectX + (i * (squareSize + squareSpacing));

This line calculates the position of each small square. rectX is the starting x-coordinate of the large rectangle. (i * (squareSize + squareSpacing)) calculates how far to move the square horizontally for each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the squares are spaced apart.
mousePressed()

The mousePressed() function is called whenever the mouse button is pressed. It's used to add interactivity, such as responding to mouse clicks. In this code, it's currently empty but can be filled with code for interactivity.
keyPressed()

The keyPressed() function is called whenever a key on the keyboard is pressed. Like mousePressed(), it's used for adding keyboard interactivity, but it is also empty here and can be customized later for keyboard actions.
draw()

The draw() function is called repeatedly, like a loop, and it updates the screen every frame. In this code, it's empty because we only need to draw the shapes once at the start, so it doesn't need to continuously update the screen.
